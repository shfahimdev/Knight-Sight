# KnightSight

**Full-Fledged Chess Game Review System (Just Started)**

---

## Description

KnightSight is a **planned, open-source chess game review system**, designed to replicate — and eventually surpass — the review experience on platforms like Chess.com. This project has **just started**, and everything currently exists only as a concept and architectural plan. No functionality has been implemented yet.

The goal of KnightSight is to be **full-fledged**, analyzing games move by move, detecting mistakes, suggesting best moves, and generating human-readable annotations once development begins.

Built for **coders, chess enthusiasts, and AI explorers**, KnightSight aims to integrate:

- **Stockfish Engine Integration** for precise move evaluation.  
- **Blunder & Mistake Detection** to identify inaccuracies and errors.  
- **Insightful Annotations** that explain moves in human-readable language.  
- **Customizable & Extendable** architecture for future features like multi-engine comparison and AI explanations.  
- **Frontend & Dashboard Ready** for interactive replay, evaluation bars, and color-coded feedback.

## Project Vision

KnightSight is more than just a chess tool — it’s a **capstone-level system project**. Every design decision, from backend engine integration to annotation logic, is intended to mirror real-world challenges in software engineering, AI applications, and even cybersecurity dashboards.  

> Built for coders who refuse to rent features and prefer **creating their own powerful tools** from scratch.
